"""
Essential stations filter for reducing UI complexity and preventing crashes.

This module filters train calling points to show only essential stations:
- FROM station (origin)
- TO station (destination)
- Platform/train changes (interchanges)
- Underground segments (ðŸš‡ Underground)
- Walk segments
- Major London terminals

This reduces UI complexity from 20+ stations to 3-5 stations per train,
preventing Qt rendering crashes while preserving important information.
