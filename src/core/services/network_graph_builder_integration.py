Network Graph Builder Integration

This module demonstrates how to integrate the WalkingConnectionService with the NetworkGraphBuilder
to ensure walking connections are only added between stations that meet all criteria:
1. Close enough for walking
2. On different lines
3. Not served by the same physical train that continues on a line

# Integration guide
"""
To integrate the EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder into your application:

1. Import the EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder:
   from core.services.network_graph_builder_integration import EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder

2. Create an instance of the EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder with your data repository:
   graph_builder = EnhancedNetworkGraphBuilder(data_repository)

3. Use the graph builder to build your network graph:
   network_graph = graph_builder.build_network_graph()

4. The network graph will now include walking connections that meet all criteria:
   - Close enough for walking
   - On different lines
   - Not served by the same physical train that continues on a line

This ensures that walking connections are only suggested when appropriate,
such as between Farnborough (Main) and Farnborough North, but not between
stations on the same line like Brookwood and Farnborough (Main), or between
stations served by the same physical train like Clapham Junction and London Waterloo.
